===================
Burgers Generalised
===================

Burgers equation is the simplified version of the Navier-Stokes equation (by dropping the pressure term). This equation can be investigated in one spatial dimension.


Building the example
====================

The fortran version of the example can be configured and built with CMake::

  cd ~/opencmiss/build/examples/
  git clone https://github.com/OpenCMISS-Examples/burgers_generalised.git
  mkdir burgers_generalised-build
  cd burgers_generalised-build
  cmake -DOpenCMISSLibs_DIR=~/opencmiss/install/  ../burgers_generalised/
  make


Running the example
===================

Fortran version::

  cd src/fortran/
  .burgers_generalised_fortran

The results can be visualised by running `visualise.com <./src/fortran/visualise.com>`_ with the `Cmgui visualiser <http://physiomeproject.org/software/opencmiss/cmgui/download>`_.


Results
=======

For the static nonlinear newton iteration problem, with 4 elements on x(0-->1) with

u(x): u(0)=1, u(1)=0

Expected results:


Exact solution:
